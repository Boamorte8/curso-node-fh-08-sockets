# Basic express

This is a template for init a nodejs project with express with dotenv configured

## To init project

```bash
 npm i
```

Create in the root project the .env file for the properties of configuration with the next variables with your own needed variables. See .exampleenv

For local dev, you can install nodemon with the following command

```bash
 npm i -g nodemon
```

and execute the following command

```bash
 npm run dev
```

In this way you don't need to restart the server on every change
